# Instant Gratification Book Retriever - Product Requirements Document

## Overview

Book Retriever is a web application that helps users retrieve their *EXISTING* reading list from Goodreads, and then check book availability at local libraries (specifically ebooks/e-audiobooks). The application allows users to see their existing reading list, see which are available instantly from the library, and then offers a link/next action to go check it out (using Libby app or Overdrive UI).

## User Stories

### Primary User Flow:
1. User provides their Goodreads RSS feed URL for their "to-read" shelf
2. Users can see their existing Goodreads to-read list
3. App automatically checks if the book is available at their local library (or multiple, in the future)
4. User is directed to the library's website or app to complete checkout

### Secondary Features (Future Enhancements):
1. User can rate and review books they've read
2. User can categorize books (e.g., "want to read," "currently reading," "read")
3. User can receive notifications when unavailable books become available

## Functional Requirements

### Book List Retrieval
- Retrieve books from Goodreads "to-read" shelf via RSS feed
- Display book details (title, author, cover image, publication date)
- Add books to a personal reading list
- Remove books from the reading list
- Persist reading list between sessions

### Library Availability Check
1. Configure local libraries with necessary information:
   - Library name
   - Website URL
   - API endpoint (if available)

2. For each book in the reading list:
   - Check availability at configured libraries
   - Display availability status
   - Provide link to library website or catalog entry

### Checkout Flow
1. User selects a library where the book is available
2. User is directed to the library's website/app
3. User completes checkout process on the library's platform

## Technical Implementation Plan

### 1. Retrieving the User's Book List
- Implement Goodreads RSS feed integration to fetch "to-read" shelf
- Create UI components for book list display
- Develop functionality to add/remove books from reading list
- Implement local storage for persisting the reading list and RSS feed URL

### 2. Checking Availability in Libraries
- Create library configuration interface
- Implement library API integration for availability checking
- Develop fallback mechanisms for libraries without APIs
- Create UI components to display availability information

### 3. Checkout Integration
1. Implement deep linking to library websites
2. Create secure credential storage for library cards

### 4. Frontend & User Interface
1. Develop responsive UI that works well on mobile devices
2. Implement offline capabilities for viewing reading list

### 5. Backend & Data Handling
1. Implement secure data storage
2. Create error handling and recovery mechanisms

## Test Plan

### Phase 1: Book List Integration
- Test Goodreads RSS feed integration with various user feeds
- Verify book details are displayed correctly
- Confirm books can be added to and removed from reading list
- Ensure reading list persists between sessions

### Phase 2: Library Availability Check
- Test library configuration interface
- Verify availability checking works for different libraries
- Test error handling for API failures
- Confirm availability information is displayed correctly

### Phase 3: Checkout Process
- Test deep linking to library websites
- Verify secure storage of library credentials
- Test the complete flow from search to checkout

## Security and Compliance Considerations

- Implement secure storage for library credentials and RSS feed URL
- Ensure user data is protected and not shared without consent

## Deployment Strategy for Mobile Access

To make the application accessible from your phone for testing:

1. **Deploy to Netlify**:
   - Netlify offers free hosting for static sites and single-page applications
   - Automatic HTTPS and custom domain support
   - Simple CI/CD pipeline from GitHub

2. **Setup Process**:
   - Connect your GitHub repository to Netlify
   - Configure build settings (build command: `npm run build`, publish directory: `dist`)
   - Deploy the application

3. **Mobile Access**:
   - Access via mobile browser using the Netlify URL
   - Add to home screen for app-like experience
   - For Phase 6, implement full PWA capabilities for offline use

4. **Testing on Mobile**:
   - Use responsive design testing during development
   - Test on actual devices before deployment
   - Use browser developer tools to simulate different devices

This deployment strategy allows you to quickly get a working prototype on the web that you can access from your phone, while setting the foundation for more advanced features in later phases.
